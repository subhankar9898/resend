    <div class="text-left max-w-md gap-4 grid grid-cols-1">
      <p>
        Resend started with an open source project in 2022. We were frustrated by
        how difficult it was to build modern email templates that worked well
        across all email clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we started to dig deeper, it became clear that this was just the tip of
        the iceberg. We realized that sending emails that reach the inbox (not the
        spam folder) was the biggest pain point, so we started to explore
        something new.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, we launched an entire email sending platform and joined Y
        Combinator's winter batch. We're creating something special here, and
        we're excited to build it with you.
